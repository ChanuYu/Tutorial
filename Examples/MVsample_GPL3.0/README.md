SpMV/DMV: matrix multiplication kernel example
----------------------------------------------
- Core part of many HPC workloads including HPL(Linpack), Q-AD
- It is impractical to run the HPC workloads as it is, so we extract only the core parts (SpMV/DMV)
- For more information regarding real HPC workloads, please refer to the URL below:
